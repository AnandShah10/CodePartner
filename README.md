# CodePartner — The Premiere Agentic AI Coding Companion

![CodePartner Hero](media/hero.png)

**CodePartner** is a powerful, agentic AI co-pilot designed to transform how you build software. Unlike traditional chat extensions, CodePartner is built from the ground up with an "agent-first" philosophy—meaning it doesn't just suggest code; it plans, executes, and iterates on complex tasks directly in your workspace.

Whether you're refactoring a legacy codebase, building a new feature from scratch, or researching complex documentation, CodePartner is your autonomous partner in the editor.

## ✨ Why CodePartner?

In a world of simple "chat-with-file" extensions, CodePartner stands out by offering:

- **🎨 Premium Visual Experience**: A stunning, VS Code-native sidebar using modern glassmorphism design. It's not just a tool; it's a premium extension of your workflow.
- **⚡ Two Ways to Work**: 
  - **Fast Mode**: For quick questions, snippets, and bug fixes.
  - **Planning Mode**: For complex architectural changes. CodePartner will generate a full roadmap before touching a single line of code.
- **🧠 Reusable Skills**: Teach CodePartner your unique workflows. Save any set of instructions as a "Skill" and reuse it globally across all your projects.
- **🛠️ Safe & Precise Editing**: CodePartner uses advanced Search/Replace semantics. No more worrying about the AI overwriting your entire file with a partial snippet.
- **🌐 Autonomous Research**: Built-in browser control allows the AI to search the web, read documentation, and even take screenshots to verify UI changes.
- **📂 Content-Aware Search**: Mention `@workspace` and CodePartner will intelligently find the most relevant files by scanning contents, not just filenames.
